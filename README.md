## Description
Favorite Things Webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Arrays)

### Website should have:

* _ Favorite Things Webpage  (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) that asks user a series of questions about their favorite things. Then, write code that gathers each of these form input values and places them into one array.
After this is done, use your site to practice targeting and moving elements between arrays:
Use square bracket notation to access the second, first, and third elements of the original array of favorite things.
Then, use push() to add only these elements to a brand new array.
Finally, display this new array in your page's HTML as list items in a <ul> tag.
